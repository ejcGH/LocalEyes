    <h3>The Pitch</h3>
    <p>
        LocalEyes is a solution for catching those "hidden" deals that get overlooked by lack of advertising, or by just not being familiar with the area         you are in.
        Whether you are in town on vacation or going out on a business trip, this app allows users to explore wherever they are and to shop how and where         the locals do.

    <h3>The App</h3>
    <p>
        With React Bootstrap and CSS3, a simple direct UI was acheived highlighting the purpose of the application - the deals.
        User can scroll through posts from locals and view items along with their sales description. 
        By displaying a photo of the product and a static Google map of the vendor, the user will know exactly what they are looking at and where to get         it. Registered users will have access to upload deals that they may comes across and contribute to the LocalEyes community.
        The upload feature allows users to enter details of the sales they find and also provide a photo to help others identify the product at hand.
        With the edit and delete buttons, user can modify their posts after they are uploaded.<br>
        All registered users have their credentials stored in a database where their passwords are hashed for security.
        Logins are only allowed with valid credentials. Users are prompted with error messages if credentials are incorrect or if they do not exist               at all. All posts are also stored in the LocalEyes database, which allow posts to be edited and searched for in the application.
